The chatbot also suggested useful follow-up questions like:
•	“How does serverless differ from traditional IaaS?”
•	“What is Function-as-a-Service?”
This allowed me to deepen my understanding in a structured and interactive way.
 
Why it was useful:
This feature turned my static lecture files into an interactive learning experience. It saved time by pulling relevant content instantly and helped me revise technical concepts through a dialogue-like interface, just like having a personalised tutor.
2. Study Guide – Auto-Generated Practice Questions for Revision
NotebookLM generated a Study Guide based on my course content titled “Cloud Platforms Study Prep – BUS5001”. This guide included short-answer questions like:
•	Explain the role of Azure Blob Storage in cloud data pipelines.
•	What is a linked service in Azure Data Factory and how is it used?
The questions were all tailored to the topics from my uploaded PDFs (especially ADF and serverless workshops) and designed for 2–3 sentence responses — ideal for exam practice.
 
Why it was useful:
The study guide encouraged active recall, helping me identify weak areas in my understanding. By attempting the questions without notes, I could gauge my preparation level and focus on gaps before the exam.
3. Timeline – Learning the Evolution of Cloud Data Technologies
I used the Timeline feature to explore the history of cloud data platforms. The AI-generated timeline (based on my lecture content) included key milestones:
•	1970s: Emergence of Relational Databases (RDBMS)
•	1998: NoSQL coined by Carlo Strozzi
•	2003–2012: Development of Hadoop and Spark for big data processing
•	2020s: Rise of Lakehouse architectures (Databricks)
This timeline was titled “Cloud Data Evolution Timeline” and helped me visualize how data technologies evolved into the modern cloud systems we study today.
 
Why it was useful:
It provided historical context, linking older technologies like flat files and RDBMS with modern innovations like Delta Lake and Databricks. This was helpful in assignment writing and understanding why newer cloud platforms were developed.
4. FAQ – Instant Clarifications on Technical Terms
The FAQ feature allowed me to quickly access definitions of terms and concepts I was likely to encounter in my final exam or assignment. One of the most useful questions it answered was:
“What is Databricks and how is it used in data pipelines?”
NotebookLM replied with:
“Databricks is a cloud-based data engineering platform built on Apache Spark. It integrates storage and compute to enable scalable ETL pipelines, machine learning workflows, and business intelligence applications.”
It also gave me definitions for terms like:
•	Data Lakehouse
•	Azure Synapse
•	ETL vs ELT

 
Why it was useful:
This worked like a smart glossary, giving me fast and accurate answers grounded in my course content — much better than searching through the PDFs manually or Googling unclear definitions.
5. Briefing Document – Research Summary Across Multiple Topics
Finally, I used NotebookLM’s Briefing Document tool to generate a summarised handout titled “Cloud Integration and Data Governance Overview”. This AI-generated report included key takeaways from all my lecture notes, such as:
•	The benefits of using Azure Data Factory (ADF) for orchestrating ETL workflows
•	How serverless computing supports agile deployment and scaling
•	Governance features required for managing cloud data pipelines
The structure included subheadings, bullet points, and citations, making it ideal for use as an assignment prep sheet or revision summary.
 
Why it was useful:
It helped me connect the dots across multiple topics like ADF, serverless computing, and data governance. I used it as a quick reference while writing my final assignment — saving time and improving content quality.
Summary
In this academic scenario, NotebookLM acted as a comprehensive learning companion by turning my lecture files into interactive content. I could:
